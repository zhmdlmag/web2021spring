        <p><strong>Monday</strong></p>
        So I woke up and made some eggs to the breakfast. I have cleaned up and studied a bit. I was studying Web-Development and Digital-Desig where I am doing well :) <br>
        After the studies and some classes I went to my work. I work as Support Associate in the Wolt Company. I do my homework just in the night because I can't be in time always :(

        <p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p>
        I was late to my Philosophy class, I was upset, but one of my friends said there was nothing serious, so that's pretty okay. I feel that my days are just routinefor now, I am very tired :(
